0,mo.huda,"Echo dot. Alexia, can you......",5,"Excellent product and does exactly what it says on the tin!  My wife gets a useful reminder to take her medication. Able to access radio stations easily and ask the odd question quicker than having to type into the search box. A good update for weather and travel, using my phone less or should I say use my phone for the other tasks whilst asking Alexia for other things. I have now brought another one for the bedroom with a clock, so now an wake up to music and get ready with the radio and stop with voice when done. Really does help to make life easier. I have my Hive heating connected as well as my TP Link WiFi Mesh, so can now control these with my voice, just makes life a little easier. Waiting to pair more gadgets in due course. A great little device and prefer 3rd generation device to the 4th in shape and size. Good sound from this little compact and good looking device. Read full review"
1,terry.colbert20...,Excellent product. Wrong Plug.,2,Nothing wrong with the product. But it came with a USA plug. Apparently that's written somewhere in the listing - it obviously escaped my attention....! Had to buy the UK plug at £17 because I didn't want to use an adapter and have the thing sticking out about a foot from the wall! So in the end I might just as well have paid the £50 for the original UK one.
2,777flyer,Amazing piece of tech,5,Works perfectly in conjunction. With my echo spot.  Has a real quality feel and is also fairly heavy adding to the quality.  Has been extremely easy to integrate into our home with all the smart home technology items we have.  One thing though is there is an issue with BT home hub and the connections with Alexa.  Apparently this is a known settings issue with the solution widely mentioned online.  I did call amazon support who were surprisingly quick to respond but I had already resolved the issue before their response.  I never though that we would benefit from this but it’s so clever especially when you set up routines.  It’s very intuitive and easy to set up speaker quality is surprisingly good considering the units small size.  In some ways we have become a bit addicted to adding more peripherals because it is so clever.  Highly recommended Read full review
3,runnerf_80,Compact and easy to use,5,"The second Amazon Echo Dot I have purchased which will be used for radio, no music subscription. Simple to set up and connect to wi-fi in a matter of minutes. At the moment not planning to use the full features of Alexa, happy with ease of being able to issue voice instructions to change radio stations, increase/decrease volume and basic enquiries, weather, news etc.. 

Sound quality and volume satisfactory for my needs.  "
4,bonnietheblueki...,"Perfect little gadget, very clever.",5,"Brilliant little gadget, great for sitting round the dinner table after eating and taking it in turns to ask Alexa to play a favourite song from the past. Gets you singing along and so much better than watching TV and not communicating. Also great for waking you up to music in the morning, just tell Alexa what you want to hear and what time to wake you. Best little gadget I've bought in ages!"
