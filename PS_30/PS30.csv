1,Flipkart Customer,4,Delightful,"A Midrange phone from OnePlus.Why I choose this phone is only because of the Brand value.We have more other options like Vivo T1 ,Realme 9,9pro , Oppo ,Motorola.But the OnePlus has their own premium feel The reason why I have given only 4 star:-1-The AMOLED display is not there.But it is not important.2- Wide angle lens is also not there.3- They have removed Alert slider.Other wise the phone is perfect. I am satisfied with this device 95%.You can go for it.The important thing is tha..."

3,Prashant Kumar,3,Decent product,Camera is good..battery draining fast after some days..speed is good no issue .. sound is also good but there is no dual speaker so what else u can expect.. overall it's a good phone in this price range of 20k
4,Sree Lakshmi,4,Nice product,"So I was sceptical about buying this budget phone of a premium brand as I guessed there would be obviously some shortfalls as compared to the normal range phones like oppo, realme etc. I have been using this phone since a week and I shall write my reviews based on my user experience.

6,Ehthishamul Haque,3,Decent product,"Good phone but battery is not up to the mark. Battery drains faster when it's moderate usage. 33w charger is the only plus.Phone feels little heavier while comparing other phones at this price segment.OnePlus logo is not clearly visible at backside.Some features like ""Google Service for VR"" is not working in this model.Overall I can give 3 rating out of 5."

9,Vamsi Krishna PVVN,1,Worthless,"Being a OnePlus user for more than 5 years, with the same expectations, I ordered this phone but was utterly disappointed.On the first day of use, I feel using my old  OnePlus 6t is best to use to date.Pros: good Battery back up, fast, no heating observed even playing game for more than 1 hour, fast face recognition and unlock.Cons: (strictly in my opinion) The display seems poor, the rear camera was not impressive, finger print sensor detection is too slow.Finally, It seems to me like O..."
